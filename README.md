This project involved creating the backend server for an exisiting frontend application.  The app itself lets the user create notes that persist in a psuedo-database.  The frontend app hits the backend with basic http requests.  Concepts applied to this project include:
- Using node.js and the node package manager
- Separating code into different files *(Modular-Routing)* to make the code easier to understand
- Utilizing the file system node package to write and read files
- Correctly routing http requests
